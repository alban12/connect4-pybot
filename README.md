# Usage 

The script is a submission file for the [Connect X simulation comp](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/overview) on Kaggle. 
It makes use of SOTA methods (AlphaZero) that you can check on the notebook. 


If you plan to make a submission on the competition, you will need to package the code with the model weights using the `create_submission.py` script. This will build an archive that you can send to the competition.
